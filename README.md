# TDA596-blackboard

Laborations for the course TDA596 Distributed Systems. The labs are based on the (skeleton code)[https://bitbucket.org/beshr/tda596_distributed_systems_ht16_lab/src] given in course instructions. 

In the Labs, you are asked to implement a distributed blackboard application, using a subset of the Python programming language. Starting from a simple (barely working) implementation, it will evolve over the labs to a fully working distributed application with different properties. You need to test your implementation on the Seattle platform, a platform for networking and distributed systems teaching & research. In the context of these labs, Seattle allows you to run and evaluate your
implementation on different machines distributed around the world. Please note that Seattle should not be used for debugging purposes. You need to debug your implementation locally before running it on Seattle platform.

## Branch
There is a branch for each of the four labs. They will contain the final hand in of the lab with the same name as the branch.
